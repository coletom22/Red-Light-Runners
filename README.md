# Red-Light-Runners
Since moving to Roseville, CA, I have noticed a consistent theme of people running red-lights on main streets flying through at more than 50 MPH. According to the *National Coalition for Safer Roads*, California has the highest fatality rate for red-light running accidents. The *Highway Loss Data Institue* also cites that in 2022, **107,000** people were injured and **1,149** people were **killed** in crashes that involved red-light running across the U.S.. 

This project aims to develop software that alerts drivers of potential red-light runners utilizing strictly dashcam footage.
