# Red-Light-Runners (RLRs)
Since moving to Roseville, CA, I have noticed a consistent theme of people running red-lights on main streets flying through intersections at more than 50 MPH. According to the *National Coalition for Safer Roads*, California has the highest fatality rate for red-light running accidents. The *Highway Loss Data Institue* also cites that in 2022, **107,000** people were injured and **1,149** people were **killed** in crashes that involved red-light running across the U.S.. 

This project aims to develop software that alerts drivers of potential red-light runners utilizing strictly dashcam footage.

## Scoping
The goals of this project are develop a working prototype under relatively specific conditions.
1. The system is designed to only alert the driver of RLRs from *perpendicular* traffic.
2. The driver must be the first car in the intersection
